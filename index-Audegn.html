							<h2>‘En Route Thursdays’ is the place for those talented in the field of music, but with a 'twist'!</h2>
							<p>It is a place that takes care of all the stops, right from doing what one is supposed to do, to what may be required to package and promote the music created by the members.</br>

Problems could range from not finding time because one is stuck in a ‘nine-to-five’, offering at least 45 hours of the week to serving corporations, or, simply not having a place to ‘jam’! It is a place that offers an aggregate solution to all such problems.</p>
							<h3>A small step. A great leap.</h3>
							<p>August 2014 witnessed the start of En Route Thursdays that has now grown to include over 35 professionals who come together to jam every weekend. Along with those who have an interest in music, there are others that are involved with photo and videography. Most members get together not just to create better music than most music professionals, but also record videos that are uploaded on their respective YouTube channels – of course, these also see the ‘light of day’ through the ERT channel. For all practical purposes, this motley crew calls themselves a YouTube Jam-Pad that is based out of Gurgaon and is now expanding to Bangalore.</br>

So far, ERT has uploaded two videos they call the En Route Thursdays ‘Project’ and a few shorter ones of individual artists called En Route Thursdays ‘Profile’. Jam sessions and recordings take place on the weekends while Projects are uploaded on Thursdays.</p>

					<h3>What’s in a name?</h3>
							<p>Thursdays are the most insignificant day in a week. While Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are considered miserable by corporate guys; Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays are reserved for all sorts of ‘fun’ – Thursdays, however - usually do not have an emotion reserved for themselves! People are usually worn out by a Thursday; but are, at the same time, waiting to thank the lord for the Friday right after!

Hence, the seemingly insignificant day was assigned by the forum to symbolize the life of most people working in corporates. Thursdays are En Route to reminding all music enthusiasts about the most significant purpose in life.</p>

									<p><span>"</span> After getting into the taxing corporate life, I missed being part of the music scene. No jamming sessions, no performances, not even someone I could discuss technicalities of good music with… It was almost like my lifeline was missing.

But, thanks to ERT….I got introduced to it exactly when I realized I couldn’t stay away from music any longer, and was looking for ways to bring it back. The first jamming session itself felt like someone had re-injected life in me. I was excited and proud at the same time to be part of ERT’s flagship project!

Looking forward to many more such interesting collaborations and projects with the ERT Team, while witnessing them achieve newer & newer milestones with each passing day. <span>"</span></p>

									<p><span>"</span> I came across EnRoute Thursdays during my last few days in Gurgaon before I moved to Pune. The first video that I saw was really nice. It was not a full fledged music video but enough to convey the message that we mean music and believe in artistic depiction. What else a musician needs more than a bunch of fellow musicians to jam with few enthusiasts and getting our humble work out there to be appreciated for whatever it is, that came out of our heart. Unaltered. As all the members were someone still searching their path in music I could really connect with all of them and is in continuous touch. One of the best time I spent in my time in Gurgaon is with EnRoute Thursdays gang.  <span>"</span></p>

Enroute is a place for the learners and the dreamers. We all work together in the direction of making goo music.  We all are not great musicians but the spirit is no less. And that is what counts. <span>"</span></p>
