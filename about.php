                    <h2>En Route Thursdays is the place for those talented in the field of music, but with a 'twist'!</h2>
                                                <p>It is a place that takes care of all the stops, right from doing what one is supposed to do, to what may be required to package and promote the music created by the members.</br>

                    Problems could range from not finding time because one is stuck in a nine-to-five, offering at least 45 hours of the week to serving corporations, or, simply not having a place to jam! It is a place that offers an aggregate solution to all such problems.</p>
                                                <h3>A small step. A great leap.</h3>
                                                <p>August 2014 witnessed the start of En Route Thursdays that has now grown to include more than 150 working professionals who come together to jam every weekend. Along with those who have an interest in music, there are others that are involved with photo and videography. Most members get together not just to create better music than most music professionals, but also record videos that are uploaded on their respective YouTube channels  of course, these also see the light of day through the ERT channel. For all practical purposes, this motley crew calls themselves a YouTube Jam-Pad that is based out of Gurgaon and is now expanding to Bangalore.</br>

                    So far, ERT has uploaded many videos they call the En Route Thursdays Project and a few shorter ones of individual artists called En Route Thursdays Profile. Jam sessions and recordings take place on the weekends while Projects are uploaded on Thursdays.</p>

                        							<h4>What's in a name?</h4>
							<p>Thursdays are the most insignificant day in a week. While Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are considered miserable by corporate guys; Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays are reserved for all sorts of fun Thursdays, however - usually do not have an emotion reserved for themselves! People are usually worn out by a Thursday; but are, at the same time, waiting to thank the lord for the Friday right after!

Hence, the seemingly insignificant day was assigned by the forum to symbolize the life of most people working in corporates. Thursdays are En Route to reminding all music enthusiasts about the most significant purpose in life.</p>
